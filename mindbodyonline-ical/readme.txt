#MindBodyOnline.com iCal feeds

this script lets you grab all your bookings from mindBodyOnline, and
spits out an iCal feed. 

There are a few settings which let you customise alarms etc.


## Software

You should be able to run this on most platforms, although may need
to install the ICal modules (amongst others that probably are already
installed). 

if you're on a mac, use perlbrew[1].
