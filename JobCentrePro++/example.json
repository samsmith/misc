It will involve at least one visit to every home in the country and several million SMEs; the installation of around 53 million meters; and the establishment of a new national communications and data handling system.  Smart meters will be installed and operated by the energy supply companies (it will be the largest installation and business change programme in the industry for 40 years, costing over £11bn).  But the Government and Ofgem have major delivery responsibilities vital to the success and cost-effectiveness of the programme, including delivering the £7bn of net benefits set out in the strategic business case. \rSuccessful candidates will work on this high-profile, large-scale and rewarding programme that will be the biggest and most complex change and infrastructure programme in the energy sector since the 1960-70s.  It will be an opportunity to make a real difference to every citizen and many businesses in GB: changing the way consumers use energy in their home; and helping them save energy and reduce carbon emissions.  Smart meters will also be a key platform for enabling a future smart electricity grid, another key plank of the Coalition Governments strategy on energy and climate change policy.\rBackground\rDomestic and smaller commercial premises have traditionally used dumb meters which simply record energy consumption over a period of time, and are then read manually by meter readers.  Smart meters are a more sophisticated method of metering that enable remote access to metering data and the provision of that data to the customer to facilitate energy management. Meters will be capable of two way communications.  This technology will see an end to estimated billing, will empower energy users to better manage their consumption and allow them to play a more active role in the energy market.  \rIn short, the rollout of smart meters will play an important role in GBs transition to a low carbon economy, and help us meet some of the long term challenges we face in ensuring an affordable, secure and sustainable energy supply.\rThe programme attracts strong Parliamentary interest, as well as interest from the media, industry and consumer stakeholders.  Other countries, including the EU are also watching very closely, seeking to learn from the UKs experience of smart meters. The interest will continue to grow as we approach the formal start of the roll-out and key issues such as data security, privacy and consumer impacts come increasingly to the fore.  \rProgramme Management Office\rThe Smart Meters Programme Management Office function will initially be contracted from an external supplier, to establish industry standard tools, templates and processes.  The PMO will be responsible for establishing and maintaining best practice programme management disciplines and processes for Phase 2.  It will act as the dynamic hub for the programme, setting the delivery pace and managing the provision of accurate and relevant information to management and other stakeholders to enable close monitoring and control of the programme. \rThe functions carried out by the PMO include:\r\tthe development of detailed plans;\r\tmanagement of the critical path and what-if analysis;\r\tprogress monitoring and reporting;\r\tthe identification and management of internal and external dependencies;\r\taligning programme plans with industry and other participants;\r\tproactive management of programme risks and issues;\r\teffective change control processes with impact analysis;\r\tmanagement of a gated review process to control stage management;\r\tmanagement of a Quality Plan and continuous improvement;\r\tend of stage reviews and promulgation of lessons learned;\r\tmonitoring reviews, audits and scrutiny and ensuring compliance with recommendations;\r\tfinancial reporting;\r\tconfiguration management of documentation;\r\tmaintaining the programme library;\r\tproviding a secretarial service for formal programme boards\rThe successful applicant will need to:\r\thave experience of contract management and working with external suppliers\r\thave significant experience of programme management and have worked in a Programme Management Office or similar environment\r\thave a concrete understanding and evidence of experience of embedding and utilising programme and project management tools and techniques\r\thave experience of using Microsoft Project, with a Prince 2 qualification desirable\r\tbe able to demonstrate a track record of working effectively in a rapidly changing environment\r\tbe resilient and willing to undertake a range of tasks to get the job done\r\tdemonstrate energy, commitment and enthusiasm at all times\rJob Description:\r1.\t\rThe post holder will report to the Head of the Programme Management Office and will be responsible for :\r\tcontract management of the external work package\r\trecruitment of civil servants to replace the external resources \r\tensuring and managing a skills transfer from the supplier\r\tplay a key role in managing the PMO functions outlined above and managing members of the PMO team, once the PMO function has transferred to being staffed by Civil Servants\r\tmanaging one SEO in initially and subsequently recruit and lead a team of 4-6 civil servants\rFurther Information:\rSpecialist skills:\rEssential\r\tSignificant experience of working in a programme/project management environment. \r\tSignificant experience of planning and risk management\r\tExcellent understanding of project management tools and techniques \r\tGood working knowledge of Microsoft Project \rDesirable:\t\r\tPrince 2 qualification\r\tFinancial management\r\tKnowledge management\rDevelopment opportunities and training:\rThe post holder will have the chance to play a significant role in a high profile government programme, with close interest from Ministers and throughout the energy industry.

The Government ICT Strategy, published in March 2011, described the longer term programmes of reform to improve Government ICT and deliver greater savings.\rPlans are focused on standardising government ICT. In the past, government departments worked to their own requirements and often procured expensive bespoke ICT systems and solutions to meet them. As a result, departments have been tied in to inflexible and costly ICT solutions which together have created a fragmented ICT estate that impedes the efficiencies created by sharing and re-use. It also prevents government from offering joined-up, modern, digitally-based public services that are suited to local requirements. Affordability in the current age of austerity requires a different approach.\rSuccess or failure of government ICT depends on greater business preparedness, competency in change management and effective process re-engineering. Government will ensure collective engagement with industry so that we work in partnership to adapt to the new approaches and technologies set out in the Government ICT Strategy. In doing so we can drive down our costs by creating a more open and competitive marketplace from which we procure services and solutions.\rThe purpose of the O&S Board will be to assess and make recommendations around the technical, commercial and \"future proofing\" of cross government IT spend requests received, prior to them being sent for ministerial approval.\rThe O&S Board will be the final stage of a three stage ICT approvals process, and is preceded by Triage and Compliance stages. \rKey responsibilities\rWe are looking to identity a pool of 20 volunteers. Three to five members of the O&S Board will meet weekly to review the business cases and draft recommendations made by the ICT Futures Team. This meeting will either be face to face or via telecon/video-conference and last no more than 90mins.\rPrior to each weekly Board meeting the appropriate O&S Board members attending the meeting will receive copies of the business cases and recommendations.\rThe role of members and the O&S Board is to review, assess and make additional recommendations on the business cases and ICT Futures recommendations.

A key area of work is the use of Social Network Analysis, which involves some analysts deploying to support operations in this area as well as underpinning work to improve our use of the method. Counter Terrorism is a growing area of work.\r\tResilience & Security Team - Leads on work to develop Government and social resilience and understand and address risks to national security. The team draws heavily on risk analysis within its work. \r\tInfluence Analysis - Undertakes research into influencing groups and individuals.
